# Versioning for ALZ-Monitor

The primary deliverable of this repo is a collection of Azure Policy initiatives and associated Azure Policy definitions, and as such is versioned in a manner consistent with the [Azure Policy versioning guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/versioning).

While this is sufficient for the purposes of individual policies, to further ease adoption of the policies a new release of the repo as a whole will be made available as one or more policies are updated with breaking changes as per the [Azure Policy versioning guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/versioning).

As new versions are released, update guidance will be provided to allow you to update your existing deployments to the new version.
